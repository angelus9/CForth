This directory contains scripts for use with Marvell's eXtreme Debugger
(XDB) JTAG debugger program.  Their purpose is to load and run CForth
and Open Firmware on OLPC XO machine.

See http://wiki.laptop.org/go/SPI_FLASH_Recovery_for_XO-CL4_Using_JTAG

You may need to copy cforth.img and ofw.rom files into this directory
once it is installed under xdb/ on the XDB host machine, if those files
are not already present or are out of date.
